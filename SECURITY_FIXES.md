# Security Fixes Applied

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Exposed Private Keys and API Keys
**Issue**: Private keys and Infura API keys were hardcoded in multiple files
**Fix**: 
- Removed hardcoded credentials from `.env`, `hardhat.config.js`, `backend/server.js`, and `frontend/index.html`
- Added placeholder values with clear instructions
- Implemented secure private key input in frontend

### 2. Smart Contract Security
**Issue**: Missing input validation and access controls
**Fixes Applied**:
- Added bounds checking for campaign ID in all functions
- Added minimum contribution validation
- Added creator-only access control for `releaseFunds`
- Added campaign completion check in `refund` function

### 3. Backend API Issues
**Issue**: Missing API endpoints that frontend was calling
**Fix**: 
- Replaced non-functional `/api/create-campaign` with `/api/save-campaign`
- Added `/api/update-campaign` endpoint
- Added `/api/campaigns/:id` endpoint for individual campaign retrieval
- Added proper input validation for all endpoints

### 4. Frontend Security
**Issue**: Private key handling was insecure
**Fixes**:
- Removed hardcoded private keys
- Added secure private key input form
- Added warning messages about private key security
- Implemented proper connection/disconnection flow

## Setup Instructions

1. **Environment Variables**: Update `.env` file with your actual values:
   ```
   INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_actual_infura_project_id
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_actual_private_key
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
   ```

2. **Frontend Configuration**: Update the `INFURA_URL` in `frontend/index.html` with your actual Infura endpoint.

3. **Deploy Contract**: Run deployment script to get your contract address:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

4. **Update Contract Address**: Use the deployed contract address in both backend and frontend.

## Security Best Practices Implemented

- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in code
- ✅ Input validation on all user inputs
- ✅ Access control in smart contract functions
- ✅ Bounds checking for array access
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ User warnings about private key security

## Remaining Security Considerations

- Consider using MetaMask integration instead of private key input
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Add HTTPS in production
- Consider using environment-specific configuration files
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
